---+!! ClassificationPlugin
%TOC%

---++ Description
ClassificationPlugin is a taxonomy and folksonomy extension for Foswiki that allows you to 
manage knowledge assets stored in your wiki. Users can organize their content by filing 
topics into categories and by adding offhand tags. Classifying content using categories and tags
are the key factors to foster sustainable knowledge management. This becomes even more important
in a wiki environment where content is created quickly but has to be made available for a longer period of time.

Categories become the backbone spanning all of your content. Content can then be retrieved by browsing
categories narrowing down search results interactively in addition to the normal full-text search.

---++ Key features 
   * *Multilevel facet navigation*: Wiki content is displayed dynamically by browsing a category tree or 
     by means of interactive tag clouds. 

   * *Managing taxonomies the wiki way*: Categories in a taxonomy are first-class wiki citizens that can be created,
     renamed, managed and reused as easily as normal wiki topics.

   * *Expressive knowledge models*: Categories may form poly-hierarchies
     where categories can have multiple parent categories. Wiki documents can be filed into multiple
     categories at the same time.

   * *Multidimensional classification*: A wiki document may participate in multiple taxonomies and folksonomies
     at the same time. Different facets of a document can be separated in a clean way.

   * *Reusing and merging taxonomies*: A category tree once defined in one web space can be imported into another
     web space effortless. You are free to chose which part of a tree you want to import. Multiple category trees
     from a number of web spaces can be merged and reassembled differently in a new web. That way predefined
     taxonomies can be managed in a centralized way and reused as needed in different webs. Any change to a taxonomy
     in one place will automatically show up in all webs that imported it.

   * *Tagging for corporate intranets*: While categories establish a predefined vocabulary, tags are a way to
     assign keywords to wiki content in an ad hoc fashion. This completes category knowledge management in
     a natural and fruitful way.

   * *Standardized <nop>WikiApplicatons*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin conforms to the <nop>WikiWorkbench application
     framework that grants for scalable and long-term maintainable <nop>WikiApplications.

   * *Extensibility*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin serves as a building block for further <nop>WikiApplications
     to be integrated in an overall knowledge management infrastructure. It serves as a middleware for a couple
     of higher order applications, like blogging, forums and skills management available separately.

   * *Document types*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin adds a couple of document types to the standard set that come with
     the <nop>WikiWorkbench. This gives you maximum flexibility in your knowledge management initiative. Further
     document types can be derived with ease. These will automatically participate in the overall knowledge management
     framework.

   * *Facetted Search*: <nop>ClassificationPlugin integrates well into Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin using tags and 
     categories to drill down into search results.

---++ Syntax Rules
=%<nop>HIERARCHY{...}%=

Format strings may contain the following:
   * =$time= expands to the calculated time difference
   * =%$= expands to a =%= char
   * =$$= expands to a =$= char
   * =
= expands to a linefeed
   * =$t= expands to a tab space
   * == expands to the empty string

---++ ISA
Predicate that checks if a topic is filed in a specific category or one of its subcategories
Also available in <nop>DBCacheContrib search expressions.

---++ SUBSUMES
Predicate that checks if a category is a parent category of another. 
Also available in <nop>DBCacheContrib search expressions.

---++ SIMILARTOPICS
Returns a list of topics that are similar to the current one. Similarity between two
topics is a value expressed in percentage, where 100% means that the topics are extremely
similar and 0% means that the compared topics aren't corelated at all. The similarity
is computed on the base of the categorization and tagging information using a
weighted matching coefficient.
